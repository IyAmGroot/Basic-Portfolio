            <p>My name is Eric Finney. I am an aspiring web developer. As a contracting professional, I've supported several
                EPA clients and Army clients. I've had experience coding in a client-server environment as a Sybase PowerBuilder
                developer. I currently work as a Microsoft SharePoint administrator supporting the army.</p>

        <section id="section2">
            <p> I am a long suffering Redskins fan, but am old enough to have witnessed their three superbowls. I also like the
                Nats and DC United and can't believe our dumb luck in acquiring Wayne Rooney. I also like to travel and fish
                with friends and family. I have two kids in college which means I'm broke, happily sending my money to help
                my kids figure out their lives.</p>
