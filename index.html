                <p>My name is Eric Finney. I am an aspiring web developer. As a contracting professional, I've supported several
                    EPA clients and Army clients. I've had experience coding in a client-server environment as a Sybase PowerBuilder
                    developer. I currently work as a Microsoft SharePoint administrator supporting the army. This requires
                    me to work on the client site where pop ins from the client happen on a regular basis, which is great
                    unless you need your own quiet space to get work done. Working as a developer gives you the ability to
                    work off site with your team or by yourself.</p>
                <p> I am a long suffering Redskins fan, but am old enough to have witnessed their three superbowls wins. Always
                    hopeful, but have had my faith tested thanks to the troll who bought the team in the 90s. I also like
                    the Nats and DC United and can't believe our dumb luck in acquiring Wayne Rooney. I also like to travel
                    and fish with friends and family. I have two kids in college which means I'm broke, happily sending my
                    money to help my kids figure out their lives. </p>
